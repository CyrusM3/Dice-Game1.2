      <p>
        This is a fun dice game in which two players race against each other to
        reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until
        either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the
        rolls. At any moment during a player's turn, the player is faced with
        two decisions:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Roll</strong>- If the player rolls a <strong>1</strong>: the
        player scores <strong><span>nothing</span></strong> and it becomes the
        opponent's turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2 - 6</strong> the number is added to the player's current total
        and the player's turn continues.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Hold</strong> - The current total is added to the player's total
        score and it becomes the opponent's turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good luck <br />
